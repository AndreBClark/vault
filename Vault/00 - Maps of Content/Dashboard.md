> [!info] Example Vault
> This is a minimal example vault to demonstrate the usage of tracking #Task tags via daily notes and displaying them on a GitHub-style contribution graph dashboard page, as seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/hdYzsdUZ9Jg).
> 
> This vault contains several plugins and CSS snippets to help achieve this, though many are not necessary for the core idea. You may explore and tinker with this vault to discover how it works and apply this example to your own vaults!
